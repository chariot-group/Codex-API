# This GitHub Actions workflow is a template designed to block pull requests (PRs) that originate from unauthorized source branches.
# It is intended to be used with `workflow_call` so it can be reused across multiple repositories or workflows.
#
# Inputs:
#   - source_branch: The only branch allowed to create PRs to the target branch.
#   - target_branch: The branch that should only accept PRs from the specified source branch.
#
# The workflow will fail if a PR is opened to the target branch from any branch other than the authorized source branch.
# This helps enforce branch protection policies and maintain a controlled development workflow.
